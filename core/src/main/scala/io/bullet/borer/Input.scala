   * NOTE: This method will never be used to move the cursor beyond the beginning of the input.
   *       As such, no range check is required by the implementation.
   *       Also the maximum number of bytes that is unread, _in total_, will never exceed 255.
   *       So any input will never have to cache more that the last 255 bytes from the head of the input.

   * Also: Decoding CBOR never needs unreading, so if your use case doesn't have to support JSON
   *       then it's file to simply "implement" this method with `???`.
