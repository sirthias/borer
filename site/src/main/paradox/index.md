borer
=====

Complete
: _borer_ supports all [CBOR] and [JSON] features, incl. "over long" integers, 16-bit half-precision floats,
`BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`, custom tags and "simple values".

Lightweight
: _borer_ has zero external dependencies and its code is relatively compact.

Fast
: _borer_ features DOM-less pull-parsers with one-element look-ahead and is designed for a good tradeoff between
performance and usability. It supports stream parsing (in constant memory, even for very large files) and consistently
@ref:[outperforms](borer-core/JSON-performance.md) most other serialization libraries targeting [CBOR] or
[JSON] that are available to [Scala] developers.

Flexible
: _borer_ tries hard to make integration into your applications environment as seamless as possible.
The type-class based design makes a lot of aspects deeply and easily customizable.<br>
Also, since _borer_ offers a unified API for both, [CBOR] and [JSON], it's very easy to provide "bilingual" REST APIs
that can consume and produce both formats interchangibly.

Debuggable
: _borer_ offers convenient in-depth logging of the encoding/decoding process that is very helpful for debugging
serialization issues, especially when working with a binary format like [CBOR].

Scala JS and Scala Native
: All _borer_ modules (except for `borer-compat-akka` and `borer-compat-pekko`) support [scala.js] as well
as [Scala Native].
