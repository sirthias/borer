License
=======

_borer_ is released under the [MPL 2.0][1], which is a simple and modern weak [copyleft][2] license.

Here is the gist of the terms that are likely most important to you (disclaimer: the following points are not legally
binding, only the license text itself is):

If you'd like to use _borer_ as a library in your own applications:
:  - **_borer_ is safe for use in closed-source applications.**
   The MPL share-alike terms do not apply to applications built on top of or with the help of _borer_.
:  - **You do not need a commercial license.**
   The MPL applies to _borer's_ own source code, not your applications.

If you'd like to contribute to _borer_:
:  - You do not have to transfer any copyright.
:  - You do not have to sign a CLA.
:  - You can be sure that your contribution will always remain available in open-source form and
   will not *become* a closed-source commercial product (even though it might be *used* by such products!)

For more background info on the license please also see the [official MPL 2.0 FAQ][3].
